# LAB-III
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a semester-long project for the course ENGG54 – Integrated Laboratory III, part of the Computer Engineering program at UFBA. The goal of the project is to reconstruct built-in audio effects of the Vedo A8 digital mixer using the Texas Instruments TMS320C5502 eZdsp DSP development kit.
